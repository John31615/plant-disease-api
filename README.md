# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection API

A FastAPI-based Machine Learning API that detects tomato plant diseases from leaf images using a trained TensorFlow model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This API allows users to upload an image of a tomato leaf and receive:

- 🌿 Predicted disease name
- 📊 Confidence score
- 💊 Recommended remedy
- ⚠️ Warning if prediction confidence is low

The model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deployed using FastAPI.

## 📡 API Endpoint

### POST `/predict/`

Upload an image file of a tomato leaf.

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "disease": "Tomato_Early_blight",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "remedy": "Remove infected leaves and apply fungicide.",
  "warning": "✅ Prediction confident."
}
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- The free hosting plan may sleep after inactivity.
- TensorFlow is memory-intensive, so performance may vary on free tiers.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Convert model to TensorFlow Lite for lighter deployment
- Add authentication
- Connect to frontend/mobile application
- Improve model accuracy
- Add more plant classes
